This is a digit combination problem. Can be solved in at most 10 loops.

When n == 0, return 1. I got this answer from the test case.

When n == 1, _ can put 10 digit in the only position. [0, ... , 10]. Answer is 10.

When n == 2, _ _ first digit has 9 choices [1, ..., 9], second one has 9 choices excluding the already chosen one. So totally 9 * 9 = 81. answer should be 10 + 81 = 91

When n == 3, _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 = 684. answer is 10 + 81 + 648 = 739

When n == 4, _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7.

...

When n == 10, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

When n == 11, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 0 = 0

class Solution {
public:
    int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        if (n==0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int res = 10;
        int base = 9;
        for(int i = 2; i<=n && i<=10; i++){
            base *= (9-i+2);
            res += base;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
